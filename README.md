Frontend projects using HTML and CSS.


This repository comprises of following projects of mine:
â€¢***Kevin Cookie Company***: This project comprises three interconnected HTML pages, forming a website for the Kevin Cookie Company. The 'index.html' page serves as the homepage, presenting the company's branding, emphasizing the use of high-quality ingredients, and offering links to both a chocolate chip cookie recipe and an instructional YouTube video. 'recipe.html' provides the company's signature chocolate chip cookie recipe, complete with ingredients and baking instructions, and facilitates easy navigation back to the homepage. Lastly, 'order form.html' enables customers to place orders, displaying a table of cookie types and prices, and offering a form for selecting the desired cookie type, quantity, and delivery date. In sum, this project constructs a cohesive online presence for a fictional cookie company, delivering information, a recipe, and a means for customers to place orders.
