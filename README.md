# HTML and CSS

## HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are fundamental technologies used in web development to create and style web pages. They work together to structure and design the content displayed in a web browser. HTML is the backbone of a web page. It provides the structural framework for the content and defines the elements that make up a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. HTML uses tags (enclosed in angle brackets) to define these elements and their hierarchy. 

## CSS

CSS complements HTML by controlling the presentation and layout of web content. It allows web developers to define styles like colors, fonts, margins, padding, and positioning for HTML elements. CSS can be applied directly within an HTML document using inline styles, within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section, or externally through separate CSS files linked to the HTML document.

In summary, HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS enhances its appearance and layout. Together, they play crucial roles in creating visually appealing and well-structured web pages.

This repository comprises of following projects:

â€¢***Kevin Cookie Company***: This project comprises three interconnected HTML pages, forming a website for the Kevin Cookie Company. The 'index.html' page serves as the homepage, presenting the company's branding, emphasizing the use of high-quality ingredients, and offering links to both a chocolate chip cookie recipe and an instructional YouTube video. 'recipe.html' provides the company's signature chocolate chip cookie recipe, complete with ingredients and baking instructions, and facilitates easy navigation back to the homepage. Lastly, 'order form.html' enables customers to place orders, displaying a table of cookie types and prices, and offering a form for selecting the desired cookie type, quantity, and delivery date. In sum, this project constructs a cohesive online presence for a fictional cookie company, delivering information, a recipe, and a means for customers to place orders.
